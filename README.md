1. I crafted this iteration for my practice, so it begins with the basics.
2. The data was initially clean but contained some duplicate entries, which I promptly removed.
3. The exploratory data analysis (EDA) stage primarily consists of visualizations without detailed observations.
4. To ensure uniformity, I normalized the data using a Quantile transformer.
5. Lastly, parameter tuning was conducted using Optuna, although the specific code for this is omitted here.
